# Background/Motivation

## Recruitment Deviations

![Kapur 2021](beverton-holt.PNG){fig-align="center" width="329"}

A **recruitment deviation** (rec dev) is a scaling factor indicating how far off our observed data is from the theoretical curve

Hake recruitment is especially variable from year to year

## Environmental Drivers

We want to incorporate environmental drivers into hake recruitment deviation predictions

"Our results suggest that the environment more strongly influences recruitment than spawning biomass over the observed stock sizes for many stocks." (Szuwalski)

# Research Question

**How correlated must an environmental driver be with past recruitment deviations to improve future recruitment deviation predictions?**

. . .

Hypothesis: As environmental drivers become increasingly correlated with recruitment deviations, predictions will become increasingly accurate.

# Methods

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three types of stock synthesis models:

1.  **Base model with all years (1946 to 2019)**

2.  Base retrospective model

3.  Environmentally-linked retrospective model

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
load('presentation.RData')

assess.skill

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assessment of accuracy: absolute difference in the terminal year

Which model is closer (has smaller absolute difference) to the "true" recruitment deviation in the terminal year?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
load('presentation.RData')

assess.skill
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Simulate 50 fake environmental driver time series for each correlation level (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9)

. . .

2.  Run SS in MLE mode for:

-   Base model with all years (1)

-   Base model with 15 years peeled back (1)

-   Environmentally-linked models with 15 years peeled back (50 time series x 4 levels = 200 total)

. . .

3.  Compare environmental errors with base error

# Results

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inputting exact recruitment deviations for the environmental driver:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
load('presentation.RData')

recdevs0.01
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If there is no age-0 catch, what is informing the base retrospective recruitment deviation in the terminal year?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three surveys used in the recruitment deviation likelihood estimation: Fishery, Acoustic, Age-1

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
load('presentation.RData')

basemodels
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Only the age-1 survey is informing the recruitment deviation in the terminal year

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
load('presentation.RData')

noage1
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Without the age-1 survey, inputting the rec devs for the environmental driver performs very well:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
load('presentation.RData')

recdevs.noage1
```

## Discussion

What is happening in the terminal year for retrospective models?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
r4ss::SS_doRetro(masterdir = here(dirname),
                 oldsubdir = '', 
                 years = -peel,
                 extras = '-nohess'
)
```

Is there a better way to assess accuracy?

## Future explorations

-   Using the model to estimate the added SE

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
load('presentation.RData')

recdevs0.1
```

. . .

-   Simulate auto-correlated environmental drivers
