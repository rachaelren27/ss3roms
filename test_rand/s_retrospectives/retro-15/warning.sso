19 parameter init value is less than parameter min 0 < 0.001 for parm: 8 ; search for <now check> in echoinput for parm_type, will exit if prior requested
20 parameter init value is less than parameter min 0 < 0.001 for parm: 10 ; search for <now check> in echoinput for parm_type, will exit if prior requested
21 setting in starter does not request all priors, and 9 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
